        <p>The day I first beheld you I stood still,
          parched in awe,<br> yet silent storms began to rise within me as if, for the first <br> time, someone had touched my soul.
          I uttered no words,<br>
          I was already gazeing your presence,<br>
          silently, endlessly, reverently.</p>
        <p style="color:#8f0327; 
        font-style: italic;">
          <em ><b>It wasn&apos;t just a eye contact…</b></em><br>
          <em><b>it was a contact of souls.</b></em><br>
        </p>

        <p>From the day you said yes, we&apos;ve loved.
          Yes, we&apos;ve clashed.<br>
          But this wild,tender current between us I want it to flow forever.<br>
          Till we wrinkle with time,
          till your laughter loses its teeth😆
        </p>

        <p>I had been inscribing chapters
          in the quiet pages of my life,<br>
          until the one your arrived
          and turned my story
          into a living tale.<br>
          A tale of bliss and ache,
          anger and solace,
          jealousy, peace, madness,
          laughter, and stillness.
          But above all,
          a tale where we exist.
        </p>



        <p>I falter, I stumble
          yes, I do mistakes in small ways.<br>
          But I promise never shall I be the reason
          behind your tears.<br>
          I&apos;ll be the reason your lipstick gets wiped off,<br>
          but never the reason your mascara smudges.🙈</p>

        <p>Year have passed since our first word,<br>
          yet each conversation still feels
          like I missed something to say.🥹<br>
          Since you came into my life, peace is no longer just a word <br>
          it feels as though I&apos;ve met it in person.
        </p>


        <p>When we wed,The only dowry I crave
          is your untold childhood,<br>
          your teenage storms,
          your unfiltered joys and buried sorrows.💔<br>
          your incomplte wishesh so that I can carry them with care,
          fulfilling them one by one and be the reason for your smile.
        </p>

        <p>People behold the world
          through two eyes,<br>
          But I see the entire world within yours.🫠</p>

        <p>Let me paint our forever with this rhythm:<br> ( ye dhapa hua hai kahise )</p>
        <p>1 kaam karte hai,
          2 baatein karte hai.<br>
          3 pal nikaalte hai,
          4 kadam saath chalte hai.<br>
          5 baje agle din tum,
          6 din pehle lie hue jhumke pahen ke ana.<br>
          7 janmo ka vaada karna hai tumse,
          8 baras baad, jab raat ke<br>
          9 baje tum mujhse kahogi “Chalo, khaana kha lo”<br>
          To main muskurakar kahunga “ Nahi… ruko… ”<br>
          1 kaam karte hai,
          2 baatein karte hai...</p>

        <p>And finally...
          Thank you for losing your heart.<br>
          The day you did...
          was the day I won in my life.❤️💕</p>

        <p>And at last , I just want to say <br>
          Wishing you all the happiness today and always.
         
        </p>
