          <p>
            While writing this letter, I realised that we feel so deeply.
            Filter all those feelings and carve them into words is very difficult.
            I don&apos;t know where to begin, but I&apos;ll write what my heart says. I hope you will like it.💞
          </p>

          <p>
            The day I first beheld you, I froze in that moment.
            I felt a sudden rush of dopamine, silent storms began to rise within me.
            I uttered no words; I was already lost, gazing at your presence silently, endlessly, reverently.🫨
          </p>

          <p>
            In those moments, I truly experienced how time can lose its rhythm.
            According to science, a human heart can beat 70 times in a minute but your first presence ruined every law
            of
            science.
            In that fraction of a second, I saw your eyes , tendrils around your face.
            I captured every small details of you.Amidst this, our eyes met.🤌🏻✨
          </p>

          <p style="color:#8f0327; font-style: italic;">
            <em><b>It wasn&apos;t just a eye contact…</b></em><br>
            <em><b>it was a contact of souls.</b></em><br>
          </p>

          <p>
            I had been inscribing chapters in the quiet pages of my life,
            until the one your arrived and turned my story into a living tale.
            A tale of bliss and ache, anger and solace, jealousy and peace, madness and laughter,Chaos and stillness. 
            But aboveall, a tale where we exist.📖
          </p>

          <p>
            I falter, I stumble yes, I do mistakes in small ways.
            But I promise never shall I be the reason behind your tears.
            I'll be the reason your lipstick gets wiped off,
            but never the reason your mascara smudges.🫣
          </p>

          <p>
            From the day you said yes, we've loved. Yes, we've clashed.
            But this wild,tender current between us I want it to flow forever.
            Till we wrinkle with time, till your laughter loses its teeth.😆
          </p>

          <p>
            Year have passed since our first word,
            yet each conversation still feels like I missed something to say.
            Since you came into my life, peace is no longer just a word
            it feels as though I've met it in person.🥹
          </p>

          <p>
            People behold the world through two eyes,<br>
            But I see the entire world within yours.🫠
          </p>


          <p>Let me paint forever with this<br>( ye dhapa hua hai kahise )<br> 
            1 kaam karte hai,
            2 baatein karte hai.<br>
            3 pal nikaalte hai,
            4 kadam saath chalte hai.<br>
            5 baje agle din tum,
            6 din pehle lie hue jhumke pahen ke ana.<br>
            7 janmo ka vaada karna hai tumse,
            8 baras baad, jab raat ke<br>
            9 baje tum mujhse kahogi “Chalo, khaana kha lo”<br>
            To main muskurakar kahunga “ Nahi… ruko… ”<br>
            1 kaam karte hai,
            2 baatein karte hai...
          </p>

          <p>
            And finally... Thank you for losing your heart. <br>
            The day you did... was the day I won in my life.❤️
          </p>


          <p>
            And at last , I just want to say <br>
            Wishing you all the happiness today and always.🎂🥳
